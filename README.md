-- Plot

Two Gods, Ekanon and Genthia, are at war. Magic rules the universe. Magic is everywhere, in everything, and is used by
all. Humans obtain magic through stone. Creatures obtain magic through bone and must kill to get theirs. 
Bone magic is more powerful than stone magic. Powerful sorcerers rule towns and cities to protect the people against the
ever growing threat of bone magic, which over time contaminates and consumes all stone magic. Every two thousand years, 
the Conjurer's bloodline emerges to restore the balance of stone and bone magic by defeating the Lords of March.

The Conjurer is the only one who can use both stone and bone magic, creating a more powerful magic to restore the balance.
