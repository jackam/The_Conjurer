# Description : The story of the The Conjurer: Stone & Bone


Storyline--
The Conjurer, a 23 year old man with a large frame, enters a small town on the outskirts of Hillendreth. The sudden smell of branzo beans cooking catapults his mind to childhood, his time
as a slave. The Conjurer was born into slavery. Born into nothing, with nothing, and was nothing. He thought that he might just leave this world with the same, until now. He always knew he was different, he felt it in his bones. There was something about the way he observed the world, 
it was unlike the way others did. Others never noticed the small things about magic, the way it moved, bent, shined. Magic was as visual to him as the sky itself.
